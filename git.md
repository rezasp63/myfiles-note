# GIT NOTES
## Introduction:
**What is Git?**

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) used to track changes in source code and collaborate with others.

*In simple terms, Git helps you:*

* Keep a history of your code

* Work on features without breaking the main code

* Collaborate with multiple people safely

* Roll back to earlier versions if something goes wrong

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for Linux kernel development.
